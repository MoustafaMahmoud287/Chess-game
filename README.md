- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Implemented for move evaluation and decision-making.
- **Undo Move**: Ability to undo the last move during gameplay.
- **Player vs. Player**: Play with a friend on the same machine.
- **AI (Under Development)**: AI opponent with planned integration of depth search for decision-making (still in progress).

- Qt 5.x or higher (for GUI)
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- CMake (for building the project)
